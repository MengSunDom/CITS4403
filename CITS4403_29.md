# 1. Problem Statement

### Case Background

The slime mold *[Physarum polycephalum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physarum_polycephalum)* is well-known in the field of graph theory. As a brainless single-cell organism, it has been found to be equipped with "judgemental and memory power" without any nervous system. At its smallest, *Physarum* can exist as microscopic cells, which actively swim about. These cells are attracted to each other, and when they swarm together, they can merge. The result is a single giant cell called a plasmodium, which can extend for meters [1]. The shortest path problem is a significant area in graph theory which focuses on finding the minimum weight path between two vertices. The slime mold was demonstrated to have genius in finding the shortest way to its food in a simplified laboratory environment. [The path-finding experiment of slime mold [2]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czk4xgdhdY4) was originally conducted in 2006 by a Japanese research team led by [Atsushi Tero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atsushi_Tero) from Hokkaido University's Graduate School of Science [3].

### Research Motivation

We modelled this slime mold foraging behaviour in a maze as our project because of several ideal experiment features. First, its field is based on the fundamental graph theory concepts we learnt. Next, all the elements in this real-world experiment can be abstracted as points in a two-dimensional world that is similar to the segregation model and the sugarscape model we learnt in Agent-Based Modelling. Then, the brainlessness of slime mold makes it feasible to simplify and replicate in a computer-simulated environment. Finally, the original mold-maze model is extensible if we break the maze wall and put more oats around the single mold. This is another topic in graph theory called single-source shortest path. One well-known solution for this problem is Dijkstra's algorithm which we can apply for future work.

### Suitability Evaluation for Agent-Based Modelling

Our initial mold-maze model was based on Tero's shortest path problem experiment in 2006. The basic elements of agent-based modelling have a one-to-one correspondence with the components of this model. Evidently, the agent in our model is slime mold, who live in this 2-D vitural world. Next, the environment is the maze, which constrains the path of mold foraging. Then, both agent and environment have their unique attributes. The mold possesses energy or age constraints as its agent attributes, while the maze has god-given oats as its environment attribute. Finally, there is a mechanism for agent-to-environment interaction, as the slime mold instinctively searches for food to survive.

### Complexity Factor Analysis

Although our model is a simplified mold-maze experiment, it does have the potential to simulate a more complex system. In a real-world scenario, there will be more factors that can influence the behaviour of slime mold:

* The real-world foraging logic of slime mold is much more intricate than our assumption. The slime mold shows two different strategies: 
* Slime mold has its preference among various foods, and can also be influenced by repellents like salt, coffee, or light [1]. We can set the weight of different items in a maze to influence the track mold foraging in our future work.
* Slime mold is capable of learning. If the sole food source is placed on an island connected by a bridge filled with repellents, the mold will repulse, take risks, overcome, and ultimately habituate environmental interferences [1]. We can update the maze generation algorithm to better simulate this island model in our future work.
* Multiple slime molds have been confirmed of their cooperative behaviours. Using the same bridge-crossing experiment, slime molds can tranfer what they learnt by merging with each other. They possess memory ability at the cellular level and are able to transmit information to another cell body [1].

### Model Application

Our extended mold-Petri dish model was built upon another real-world research in 2010–[the mold-inspired adaptive city network design[4]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwKuFREOgmo&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fgigazine.net%2F&source_ve_path=OTY3MTQ). This application was conceived by [Atsushi Tero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atsushi_Tero) either. The single slime mold in this experiment ultimately drew a network on a wall-less Petri dish that closely resembles the Tokyo-area railway system [5]. Later followers who repeated this experiment in other countries also got nearly all interstate highways [1].

Our works align with the original intention of this computational modelling, which is to simulate and study complex systems via computer.

草稿[1]

Earlier this year, Dussutour showed that [slime molds can learn](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/283/1829/20160446)—at least, to a simple degree. She presented them with an obstacle course: To reach some food, they had to crawl over a bridge that was laced with repellents like salt or coffee. At first, the molds were clearly repulsed, and were slow to ooze across. With more repetitions, they became habituated; they got used to the chemicals, started ignoring them, and moved faster. And if Dussutour gave them a long timeout, and then reintroduced them to the bridge, they were just as reluctant to cross as they originally were.

今年早些时候，杜苏图尔证明[粘菌可以学习](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/283/1829/20160446)——至少在简单的程度上是这样。她向他们展示了一个障碍训练场：为了获得一些食物，他们必须爬过一座撒有盐或咖啡等驱虫剂的桥。起初，霉菌明显被排斥，并且缓慢地渗出。重复次数多了，他们就习惯了。他们习惯了这些化学物质，开始忽视它们，并且行动得更快。而如果杜苏图尔让他们暂停了很长一段时间，然后重新将他们引入桥上，他们就会像原来一样不愿意过桥。
